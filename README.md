MATLAB codes for the study of kinematics, dynamics, motion planning, and control of mobile robots and robot arms

Modified the IKinBody function in the MR code library to report the intermediate iterates of the Newton-Raphson inverse kinematics.
This new function is used to solve the inverse kinematics of the UR5 industrial robot, and also visualized the convergence of the
iterations using the V-REP robot simulator.
